📘 README — What Can I Do With Ansible?
Overview

Ansible is a powerful automation engine that enables you to deploy, configure, secure, and orchestrate your entire IT environment — from servers to clouds, networks, applications, storage, and more.

It helps you automate repetitive tasks, enforce consistency across systems, and manage complex workflows with simple, human-readable playbooks.

🚀 What You Can Do With Ansible
🔧 Orchestration

Coordinate multi-step processes across different systems — provisioning → configuration → deployment → validation → notification.

⚙️ Configuration Management

Manage system configurations in an idempotent and repeatable way:
users, packages, services, files, permissions, firewalls, sysctl, and more.

📦 Application Deployment

Deploy applications at scale — including build, rollout, update, and rollback.

🏗 Provisioning

Create and manage infrastructure resources in clouds or virtualization platforms
(AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, OpenStack, etc.).

🔄 Continuous Delivery

Integrate Ansible with CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automate delivery workflows.

🔐 Security & Compliance

Apply security baselines, patch systems, perform hardening, and ensure compliance with standards like CIS.
